            I’m a sophomore at the University of Michigan from Palo Alto, CA majoring in Information Analysis and minoring in Gender, Race, and Nation. My friends would describe me as multifaceted, both academically and personally ––  I love data and design, I’m analytical and creative, I’m incredibly hardworking but also prioritize my wellbeing. I’m passionate about utilizing my skills in data science and UX/UI design to create impactful experiences using empathy, intentionality, and creativity. In my free time, you can usually catch me watching the sunset or playing pickleball.
